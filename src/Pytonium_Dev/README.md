This is a python framework called Pytonium for building python apps with a GUI, 
based on web technologies. 

It uses the Chromium Embedded Framework for rendering and execution of javascript.

At the moment the framework has basic functionality for loading an url and add
Javascript bindings, so a python function can be called from Javascript.
And also Javascript can be executed, on the website, from python.

It is still at an early stage.

I will try to keep the Chromium Embedded Framework updated.

Based on cef release folder: cef_binary_106.0.27+g20ed841+chromium-106.0.5249.103_windows64
